// CyberpunkVRPort as a RED4ext plugin -- the replacement for the dxgi.dll proxy.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// As dxgi.dll we stood in front of DXGI and owned what we assumed was the process's only
// swapchain. Every path grew around that assumption. The moment a second one appeared -- the
// VRCAM mirror's window -- it broke in a new way on each attempt: our own IAT hooks recursing
// through our module, the overlay drawing into the mirror's backbuffer, a shared surface
// coming back DXGI_ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED. None of those are mirror bugs; they are consequences
// of being the proxy. The build that actually ran the mirror was a red4ext plugin with no
// proxy at all, so this puts us back in that shape.
//
// WHAT CHANGES, AND WHAT DOES NOT
//
// Almost nothing moves. The engine hooks, OpenXR submit, capture, overlay and stereo module
// are the same translation units; they never needed to be a proxy, they only needed a device,
// a queue and Present. Only the way those three are acquired changes:
//
//   device + queue : sync_stereo hooks d3d12!D3D12CreateDevice before the game creates its
//                    device and keeps both. The plugin waits for them instead of being handed
//                    them by CreateSwapChain.
//   Present        : the swapchain vtable is shared process-wide, so a throwaway swapchain
//                    exposes the same table the game presents through.
//   game window    : learned from the first Present that is not one of ours.
//
// DEPLOYMENT: this DLL goes in bin\x64\plugins\cyberpunkvrport\, and bin\x64\dxgi.dll must be
// REMOVED. Running both means two copies of every hook fighting for the same addresses.
